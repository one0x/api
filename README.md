# one0x Open Standards
Open APIs to record and fetch all learning and teaching efforts on a global blockchain.



#### BACKGROUND

Education today is no longer limited to blackboards within the four walls of a school and all methods and topics of learning may not be equally credited with returns.

In this changing knowledge paradigm, learning is continuous not episodic. Resumes aren’t trustworthy, and degrees don’t do justice to your entire learning journey.

There is a dire need to objectively quantify knowledge obtained from any and every activity.



#### SOLUTION

one0x is a self-governed decentralised framework that quantifies and keeps an anonymous track of every knowledge exchange using blockchain, the same technology that powers bitcoin.

This knowledge is recorded in units called Gyan, the new standard unit of knowledge which is equal to at least an hour of learning in any topic.

The sum of which can be your knowledge score or expertise in any particular topic. You now have a knowledge story on every topic you ever taught, learnt, answered questions or even worked on.

In the new world, every student, learner, institution and employer are empowered with these trusted Gyan scores.

 
#### THE ECONOMY

Free flowing knowledge adds value to the world and because we can now quantify it, Karma is the new currency that redistributes this value amongst its citizens based on their efforts. With Karma you can learn more, convert them to dollars or even hire the most suitable employees.

Its economics can be summed in that teaching rewards you with highest Karma, but you need to spend them to learn more; and since they are in limited supply, the quantum of learning will drive its monetary value.

So, whether a student, teacher or employer, you can now earn your true value by simply learning, sharing your knowledge and making the right hiring decisions.


#### GYAN

Gyan is the world’s first standard measure of knowledge.

World’s most secure way to keep a record of every learning transaction - at school, online, with friends or at work. Instantly earn tokens every time you learn. Also build your reputation, collaborate with peers who have similar knowledge stories and get projects from employers that match your skills.


#### KARMA

Karma tokens are the cryptocurrency empowering every learner.

An ecosystem where everyone benefits - the student, teacher and workplaces. Using the awarded Karma tokens every week, students & teachers can study for free, earn money and get access to valuable services.


#### VISION

Our vision is that educational platforms, every impactful learning institute that provides knowledge, whether it’s an online coding boot camp or a school for chefs, will join one0x:  accessible, trustworthy information about everyone’s knowledge journey and impact.

We are on a mission to create a network of passionate educators, learners, and institutes, and empower them with tools they need to make transparent what matters most about their students: from the source of their knowledge, to their impact on real world projects, jobs, and who they pass their knowledge on to next.
